# Dotfiles-macOS

A total rebuild of my older [bootstrap repo](https://github.com/obviateio/bootstrap) specifically for use on macOS. Cobled together from multiple sources, but started on macOS 11.2 Big Sur.

The goal is to provide a "one line to fully useful" machine. Installing all major applications (where possible) and setting up all the little annoying bits like fonts.

## Want to use it?

* Fork It

While most of the scripts and dot files are not-hard coded with too much "me specific" data or locations, there are still a few. Reccomend you fork this repo and look through each script to modify for your own needs.
